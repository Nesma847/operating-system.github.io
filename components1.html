  <h1>Components of Operating systems</h1>

  <h2>(1) Network management</h2>
  <p>Is the method of handling and maintaining computer networks. It involves performance monitoring, failure detection, network provisioning and service quality
  maintenance. A distributed system is a series of computers / processors that never share their own memory or a clock. Within this system type,
  all processors have their local memory in this type of device, and processors communicate with each other through various communication lines, 
  such as fiber optics or telephone lines. Network computers are connected via a communication network that can be configured in a variety of different ways. 
  By using network management tool,the network can be fully or partially connected, 
  which helps users to design routing and connection strategies that overcome connection
  and security issues</p>
  <h2>(2)File Management</h2>
	   <p>A file is a set of related information which is should define by its creator. It commonly represents programs,
	   both source and object forms, and data. Data files can be numeric, alphabetic, or alphanumeric</p>
	 <h2>(3)I/O Device Management</h2>
	 <p>One of the important use of an operating system that helps you to hide the variations of specific hardware devices from the user</p>
	  <h2>(4)Process Management</h2>
	  <p>The process management component is a procedure for managing the many processes that are running simultaneously on the operating system.
	  Every software application program has one or more processes associated with them when they are running.</p>
	  <h2>(5)Secondary-Storage Management</h2>
	  <p>The most important task of a computer system is to execute programs. These programs, along with the data, helps you to access, 
	  which is in the main memory during execution.This Memory of the computer is very small to store all data and programs permanently.
	  The computer system offers secondary storage to back up the main Memory. Today modern computers use hard drives/SSD as the primary storage of both programs 
	  and data. However, the secondary storage management also works with storage devices, like a USB flash drive, and CD/DVD drives.</p>
