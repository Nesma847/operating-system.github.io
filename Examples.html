  <tr>
    <td>1-iOS</td>
    <td>Not many software or hardware developers have had as strong of a impact on computing as Apple. The release of their mobile operating system,
   specifically designed for their iPhone and iPad devices, was and still is game changing. Designed to be intuitive and responsive, 
   iOS blends an almost desktop-like experience with a decisively on-the-go aesthetic</td> 
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>2-Android OS</td>
	 <td>There are few companies with their fingers on the pulse of tech like Google. Purchased by Google in 2005 and released on its first handset in 2008,
   Android has evolved continuously. With whip-fast controls and strong features, it has become a strong contender in the mobile operating system arena</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>3-Windows 3.x</td>
	<td>Groundbreaking at time of its 1992 release, the 3.1 version of windows brought the windows platform into true prominence. 
   Featuring loadable device drivers and virtual memory, this 16 bit version of the Microsoft Desktop OS made upgrading and maintaining PCs a much easier process
   for users</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>4-Windows 95</td>
   <td> Released, as one might suspect, in 1995, this version of the increasingly popular Windows platform was a quantum leap forward in personal computing. 
   Sporting a brand new user-friendly interface that the company would eventually repurpose and upgrade for many years, this OS had features like the start 
   menu, which revolutionized PC interfaces</td>
     </tr>
	 <tr>
	 <td>5-Google Chrome OS</td>
	 <td> Developed for mobile computing through Chromebooks, the Chrome OS is a great workhorse operating system, 
	 which can surprise a user with its nimble agility. It boots fast, has cloud functionality, and email integration, all out of the box</td>
	 </tr>
	 <tr>
	 <td>6-MAC OS X</td>
	 <td> Innovation is important to Apple’s design aesthetic. Originally created in 1984, the company’s desktop powerhouse OS has gone through many revisions.
	 Based in the Unix development language, OS X matches the competitors Windows platform feature for feature. 
	 Also, many files that can be opened on Windows can also be executed in OS X natively, something that doesn’t necessarily happen on the other platform</td>
	 </tr>
	 <tr>
	 <td>7-Linux Mint</td>
	 <td>This free, often overlooked operating system is a welcome addition to any best OS list. Secure, easy to use, and ultimately freeing when it comes to software choices, this plucky operating system has a winning design that you’ll enjoy exploring. Linux Mint also has the distinction of working well, regardless of device type.</td>
	 </tr>
	 <tr>
	 <td>8-Windows7</td>
	 <td>There are many versions of Windows on this list, but that’s because each mentioned here is a quantum leap forward insofar as design. 
	 Windows 7 helped bring the platform into modern times after the failure of the much aligned Windows Vista. Windows 7 incorporated features such as a 
	 smarter taskbar, better cross functionality between programs, and searchable programs</td>
	 </tr>
	 <tr>
	 <td>9-Microsoft DOS</td>
	 <td>This is the father of many of the operating systems on this list. Originally just a black screen with white writing,
	 MSDOS laid the groundwork for loading programs quickly, installing device drivers, and intuitive functionality.
	 Are you looking for a shiny graphical interface? This isn’t one of those types of operating systems, but when it comes to getting work done,
	 there is none better.</td>
	 </tr>
	 <tr>
	 <td>10-Windows XP</td>
	 <td>As of this writing, Windows XP, which was released in 2001, is still the number two operating system in use globally.
	 It revolutionized operating systems with many of its defining features that are still in use in newer OS’s today,
	 which is why it’s number one on our list</td>
