  <h2>Distributed operating system</h2>
  <p>Is a collection of independent, networked, communicating and physically separate computer nodes software.
  They handle jobs that are serviced through multiple CPUs. Every single node holds a particular subset of the global aggregate operating system program.
  Each subset is a composite of two separate service providers.The first is an omnipresent minimal kernel, or microkernel,
  which directly controls hardware for that node. Second is a higher-level set of components of system management which coordinates the individual and 
  collaborative activities of the node.These components abstract functions on the microkernel and support user applications.</p>
  <h2>Templated</h2>
  <p>In the distributed and cloud computing context of an OS, templating refers to creating a single virtual machine image as a guest operating system,
  then saving it as a tool for multiple running virtual machines. The technique is used both in virtualization and cloud computing management,
  and is common in large server warehouses</P>
  <h2>Embedded operating system</h2>
  <p>is an operating system for embedded computer systems. This type of operating system is typically designed to be resource-efficient and reliable.
  Resource efficiency comes at the cost of losing some functionality or granularity that larger computer operating systems provide, including functions which may not 
  be used by the specialized applications they run.Depending on the method used for multitasking, 
  this type of OS is frequently considered to be a real-time operating system, or RTOS</p>
  <h2> Real-time operating system (RTOS) </h2>
  <p>It is an operating system (OS) intended to serve real-time applications that process data as it comes in, typically without buffer delays. 
  Processing time requirements (including any OS delay) are measured in tenths of seconds or shorter increments of time. 
  A real-time system is a time-bound system which has well-defined, fixed time constraints. Processing must be done within the defined constraints
  or the system will fail. They either are event-driven or time-sharing. Event-driven systems switch between tasks based on their priorities,
  while time-sharing systems switch the task based on clock interrupts. Most RTOSs use a pre-emptive scheduling algorithm.</p>
  <h2>Library</h2>
  <p>A library operating system is one in which the services that a typical operating system provides, such as networking, are provided in the form of libraries 
  and composed with the application and configuration code to construct a unikernel: a specialized, single address space,
  machine image that can be deployed to cloud or embedded environments</p>
